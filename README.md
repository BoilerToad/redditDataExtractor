redditDataExtractor
===================

The reddit Data Extractor is a GUI tool for downloading almost any content posted to reddit. Downloads from specific users, specific subreddits, users by subreddit, and with filters on the content is supported. Some intelligence is built in to attempt to avoid downloading duplicate external content.

For data scientists and curious redditors, JSON-encoded text files can be extracted for analysis. These contain all the characteristics of reddit submissions, including the title, a hierarchy of comments, the score, selftext, creation date, and more. Below is a snippet of the attributes that are retrieved.
